            <p>In this first Carto Map we distingush the properties based on the decade they were made.
                With the color white representing older decades and the darkest purple color representing 
                the current decade. To distingush between non profits and for profit buildings an outline of
                green is used to represent for profit while a yellow outline is used to represent non profit. 
                This map helps to show trends and dominance of for profit building especially in urban cities. Here is 
                the link for the following Carto Map: https://clausa.app.carto.com/map/f953349f-f20f-46b4-ac66-24ff160405fe?zoom=10&lat=37.800019&lng=-122.396057

            <p> This graph helps to understand how efficient each is in bringing profit. It directly helps answer
                our question of how the ratio of revenue to total units built by non-profit (NP) housing developers (HDs) 
                changed in Bay Area California counties from 2013 to 2022? Continuing to help the exact subject of our research 
                by showing real data of profit between these two types of business.  </p>

            <p>Along with the visual understanding of how for-profit businesses vastly outnumber non-profits, from the provided carto map, 
                there is another incentive that helps for-profits grow tremendously, annual awards. This graph helps us to understand where 
                priorities land, as these grants can help generate extra funds for them and allow for at least some sort of investment return. </p>

            <img src="aob.png" alt="Image 3">
            <p> The drastic outperformance of for-profits over nonprofits is once again highlighted in this graph. With the context of previous graphâ€™s,
                it can become clear how this efficiency is not entirely due to for profit being better. When considering just monetary reward, it can be 
                hard to see how the constant construction can be detrimental to nature when instead thinking of profit over morals.  </p>
