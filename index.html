effectiveness, as measured by the ratio of funding to total units, of projects built by non-profit housing developers (NPHDs) impacted by choices during the development process?</span><span class="c4 c12">&nbsp;NPHDs do not have a principal obligation to maximize profit, freeing such organizations up to serve unprofitable communities and prioritize community revitalization. The hypothesis is the freedom of prioritizing community revitalization will allow NPs to develop housing targeted to vulnerable communities in a lower environmental impact way, increasing funding required per unit. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c12">California state tax credit data, federal funding data, and non-profit tax exemption filings revealed that for-profit housing developers and NPHDs built and are funded at roughly the same rate, but NPHDs may make choices that are less environmentally damaging, less costly, and more likely to be targeted at increasing housing for vulnerable populations. Comparing for-profit housing developers and NPHDs by averages allows for comparison and resolves the issue of a high for-profit to non-profit organization ratio.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c12">This analysis identifies several drivers of costs and looks at the levels of federal incentives provided to both NPHDs and for-profit housing developers. Results suggest that NPHDs consider rehabilitation versus new construction, as well as location strategies to enable more cost-efficient solutions to housing shortages for those in financial need or from vulnerable populations. &nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="c11 c15" id="h.z8rz7dk5b5tk"><span class="c4 c3">Introduction</span></h2><p class="c14"><span>Affordable housing is a pressing necessity in California. Over 160,000 Californians are unhoused. Seventy percent (70%) of these lack shelter, which is disproportionate to similar highly populated states such as New York, where only 5% of unhoused individuals lack shelter (Streeter, 2022). The median U.S. home value has doubled in the last 10 years while the median household income has only increased by 13.5% and in half a decade, mean US rent has grown 1.5 times faster than wages, putting the idea of owning or </span><span>even renting a home</span><span class="c4 c12">&nbsp;increasingly out of reach for many people (Coakley, 2024; Lee, 2024). The high number of unhoused individuals, along with an increased disparity in income and housing costs, emphasizes the need to find a sustainable solution to building affordable housing that can help combat housing instability.</span></p><p class="c14"><span>The unaffordability of housing is a higher predictor of homelessness compared to other risk factors such as substance use, health and general economic conditions across US metropolitan areas (Horowitz, 2023). To lower housing costs, thereby lessening the number of unhoused individuals, an effective solution is establishing funding and incentive programs that increase the availability of affordable and subsidized housing (ASH) (Streeter, 2022). ASH can help decrease the size of the unhoused po</span><span>pulation and increase the proportion of those with shelter by reducing the financial burden of home expenses, enabling individuals to enter the housing market and maintain housing over time. &nbsp;Affordable housing provides a stable expense that individuals are more likely to be able to afford and budget for. Subsidized housing allows </span><span class="c4 c12">individuals to maintain a lower rent in a higher-cost market by providing government assistance to pay a portion of the rent. Both types of housing aid have been proven to help reduce the amount of families forced to live on the street (Fischer, 2019). </span></p><p class="c14"><span>Building new housing requires a lot of money, especially in California, where the cost of property, labor, and materials is higher than in other states (Bratt, 2007, p. 37). Various governmental and non-governmental bodies offer financing and incentives to build ASH housing to both for-profit (FP) and non-profit (NP) Housing Developments (HD) (Blumenthal, 2016; Dillon, 2022). Unlike FP firms, which are incentivized by their owners and investors to only take on projects that maximize profit, NPs can prioritize neighborhood revitalization and community development projects that would not be profitable without assistance (Bratt, 2007, p. 44). These different incentives allow NP HDs to focus on less profitable communities, long-term affordability and </span><span>dwellings</span><span>&nbsp;designed for targeted groups of tenants that are more vulnerable, such as families or people with disabilities. &nbsp;The features suggest that NPs are a necessary part of the solution to sustainably combat housing insecurity across California (Bratt, 2007, p. 44). </span></p><p class="c14"><span>Affordable housing funders such as the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provide programs, such as tax incentives, grants, and other funding, &nbsp;to incentivize the building of affordable housing (California, 2024; US, 2024). These bodies enabling affordable and subsidized housing want to understand how the money is being used. The sponsors of these programs look for a return on investment to see where the money can make the most impact and ensure the money is being properly allocated to increase affordable housing. This paper dives into how the choices made by NP and FP HD affect the cost-effectiveness of their different projects in California. The allocation of these resources is vital to creating and maximizing affordable housing to help combat unhoused populations. </span></p><h2 class="c11 c15" id="h.qjvch3qw6bg7"><span class="c4 c3">Literature Review</span></h2><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c12">The cost of per-unit affordable housing construction is a serious issue in California (Jialu, 2022). As of 2022, the cost of per-unit affordable housing in California has reached over 1 million dollars, a 30% increase from 2020 (Dillon, 2022). </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c12">More funding is required for each project every year. Due to the limitations on the amount of money funders can invest in affordable housing projects, HDs usually need to go to more than 20 different funding sources for each project, mostly starting with the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) (Blumenthal, 2016). Each additional funding source slows down the process and increases the average per-unit cost by more than $6,000 &nbsp;as the HDs fulfill various regulatory and oversight requirements (Blumenthal, 2016; Dillon, 2022). As shown in Figure 1, the cost of building per-unit affordable housing in California has been increasing rapidly.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c12">This financial flywheel, requiring more funders to cover both the rising initial costs and costs of getting new funding sources, can be addressed by visibility identified through this paper&rsquo;s analysis of how project costs have changed by region over time. Prior analysis has been conducted in California at the city level, but it has not been disaggregated for NP HDs, which are the organizations more likely to be attuned to the needs of the community (Dillon, 2022). This paper&rsquo;s data analysis will support the growth of the NP HD sector by informing funding decisions that will make NP work sustainable. The greater visibility of the financial needs of NP HDs will allow funders to adjust their grant sizes to best-fit communities&rsquo; specific needs and improve the targeting of funding. Communities with greater historical investment and higher construction and housing costs may require larger grants, while underserved and lower-cost communities may not need as much funding. The necessity of the team&rsquo;s analysis supports the trend of NPs investing in community revitalization which raises the standard of living and may create additional indirect economic growth (Bratt, 2007, p. 30). The impact of NP investment in community projects may be to attract other developers and, ironically, make it less likely the NP can continue to raise sufficient funds to continue to be effective in the higher-cost environment (Bratt, 2007, p. 30). The team&rsquo;s analysis can identify counties that may be at risk of losing NPs or where NPs will require higher funding levels to continue to operate effectively.</span></p><h2 class="c11 c15" id="h.dwpjfdkjgaj"><span>Methods</span></h2><p class="c14"><span>We used data provided by </span><span class="c8"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ctcac/history.asp&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1723176649279927&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ZBLXLhkF3uulsxMvz1PlM">the Office of the State Treasurer of California</a></span><span>&nbsp;for the California Tax Credit (CATC) program, by </span><span class="c8"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/lihtc.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1723176649280302&amp;usg=AOvVaw3w_G5WpCRBwPQxhP8uc6Cb">the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</a></span><span>&nbsp;for the LIHTC database and by </span><span class="c8"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1723176649280553&amp;usg=AOvVaw2dSJnwJCDGPsBUhlX54qUi">ProPublica</a></span><span class="c4 c12">&nbsp;through the Nonprofit Explorer database (California, 2024; Suozzo, 2024; US, 2024). </span></p><p class="c14"><span>One of the issues with the data is that the NPs are not required to disaggregate funding at a granular level, so we cannot determine the exact flow of money through their filings. The grant funders who provide the money to NPs provide more robust and transparent details about the targets for the funding, but the private NP funding sources also are not required to disaggregate where they are sending money. Thus, the team relied only on public datasets such as governmental tax records and filings </span><span>which provide location and unit </span><span class="c4 c12">information. </span></p><p class="c14"><span>The CATC provided the locations of projects, the amount of tax credits provided, and what organizations were responsible for developing the project, but did not denote if the HDs were NP or not (California, 2024).</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>To determine if each project being funded was NP or not, Python code written by the team &ldquo;called&rdquo; ProPublica&rsquo;s Nonprofit Explorer API to determine if an organization (that was either the project owner or builder) with matching name and geographic data had filed forms required to be an NP as required by the IRS</span><span>&nbsp;(Suozzo, 2024). If there existed a match, the organization would be labeled as a NP. </span><span>LIHTC data included project location, funding, and NP status data, but did not include the exact organizations in charge of development (US, 2024). After adding the data from ProPublica to the CATC dataset, the LIHTC and CATC datasets were merged based on details about the projects resulting in 3,853 projects containing both CATC and LIHTC data while 2,765 only have source of data, as illustrated in Figure 4 (California, 2024; Suozzo, 2024; US, 2024). &nbsp;</span><span>CARTO mapping software was used to create maps.</span><span>&nbsp;The mean was chosen as the measure of central tendency due to its sensitivity to outliers. It is important to monitor how the highest costs of projects influence average expenditures over time especially with inefficiencies driving up costs. Projects inline with historic costs may conceal funding areas that are rapidly increasing in cost.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup></p><p class="c14"><span>To incentivize housing developers to build affordable housing, which is less profitable than other types of housing, the state of California and HUD provide funding in the form of tax credits</span><span class="c4 c12">&nbsp;(Keightley, 2023, p. 6). After a location with affordable housing is &ldquo;Placed In Service&rdquo; (PIS), it is usable as housing and the developer is given tax credits (Dunn, 2020, p. 2; Keightley, 2023, p. 6). Since it is expensive to build, developers often sell off their credits in exchange for financing for the construction (Keightley, 2023, p. 4). The PIS year is the same as the year the tax credits are released, so we will use that data to understand how much the governmental bodies budget for housing each year. </span></p><h2 class="c11 c15" id="h.fasuuykd6eiv"><span>Results</span></h2><h3 class="c18 c15" id="h.ew7hbfwoo2q1"><span class="c3 c7 c17">Research Question</span></h3><p class="c11"><span class="c4 c12">How is the effectiveness, as measured by the ratio of funding to total units, of projects built by NPHDs impacted by choices during the development process?

This is clearly illustrated in Figure 4, which shows that FP housing developers have consistently built more new construction projects than NP developers almost every year. While it may not always be feasible to build a new building or rehabilitate an existing structure, the projects NP and FP developers choose can signal their priorities and affect the efficiency of the investment. The years were chosen because they were recent enough to not be affected by factors such as changing attitudes towards construction and complete data.</span></p><p class="c11 c16"><span class="c4 c12"></span></p><p class="c11"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 518.50px; height: 431.53px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 518.50px; height: 431.53px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c3">Fig 4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Proportion of New Construction Projects in CA from 2011 to 2024</span><span>. </span><span class="c7">FP housing developers built more new construction projects than NP developers almost every year in our time span.

Both groups have increased new construction projects which imposes a greater environmental burden and costs more (Alba-Rodr&iacute;guez et al., 2017; Wilkins et al., 2015).

NPs can highlight higher rates of acquisition and rehabilitation, which may become more popular due to increasing interest in low environmental impact projects and cheaper costs. The freedom of prioritizing community revitalization did not largely impact NPs predilection to develop housing targeted to vulnerable communities in comparison to FPs. This finding suggests the focus on community revitalization is not a main driver of costs for NPs specifically. Additional analysis is warranted to determine to what extent location is the principal driver of higher cost, compared to other factors identified in this paper, and to quantify the economic return of indirect neighborhood revitalization.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c12">Those living in affordable housing, are by definition, vulnerable populations that may have already faced exploitation. The data analysis in this paper should be treated with sensitivity. The main privacy and ethical issue raised by this analysis is the implications of location data. The map of projects and cost comparisons could lead critics to target specific developers or developments for low financial efficiency without the context of how the costs are affected by decisions to serve specific vulnerable populations or support community revitalization goals. By generalizing the data to county instead of by city, one can see overall trends while reducing the likelihood of specific projects or developers being attacked for undesirable outcomes such as low financial efficiency. County generalization preserves a detailed understanding of local HD environments while ameliorating ethical and privacy issues.</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c4 c12">The data sets are public and collected through governmental financial disclosures. The funding of the data collection for both sets is by the government and collected as part of an oversight process to dissuade fraud and misuse of public funds. All of the programs funding the data collection work for the public good and are generally non-partisan. One limitation is the reliance on publicly available data which might not capture all relevant variables and future work may require creating the data set to better understand drivers of inefficiencies in cost. Figures 1 and 2, which show the funding distributions, suggest that some cities may have lower funding increases per unit. Future research can investigate deeper if the presence of more funding opportunities or demographics of a region have an impact on costs for nearby projects.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c10"><span class="c4 c12"></span></p><h1 class="c19 c15" id="h.19z16r1nxb5"><span class="c4 c3">References</span></h1><p class="c6"><span>Alba-Rodr&iacute;guez, M.
